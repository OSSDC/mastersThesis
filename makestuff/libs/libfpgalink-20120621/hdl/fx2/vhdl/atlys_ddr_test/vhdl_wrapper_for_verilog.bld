Annotating constraints to design from ucf file "atlys.ucf" ...
WARNING:NgdBuild - The value of SIM_DEVICE on instance
   'ddr_wrapper/ddr_interface/u_ddr2/memc3_infrastructure_inst/u_pll_adv' of
   type PLL_ADV has been changed from 'VIRTEX5' to 'SPARTAN6' to correct
   post-ngdbuild and timing simulation for this primitive.  In order for
   functional simulation to be correct, the value of SIM_DEVICE should be
   changed in this same manner in the source netlist or constraint file.
