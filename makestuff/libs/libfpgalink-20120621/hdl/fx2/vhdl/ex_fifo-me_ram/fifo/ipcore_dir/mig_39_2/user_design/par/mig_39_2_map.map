ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

Interim Summary
---------------
Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                   341 out of  54,576    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                 341
    Number used as Latches:                      0
    Number used as Latch-thrus:                  0
    Number used as AND/OR logics:                0
  Number of Slice LUTs:                        470 out of  27,288    1%
    Number used as logic:                      466 out of  27,288    1%
      Number using O6 output only:             342
      Number using O5 output only:              26
      Number using O5 and O6:                   98
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   6,408    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      4
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         4
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        84 out of  13,644    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          573
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           246 out of     573   42%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 103 out of     573   17%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         224 out of     573   39%
    Number of unique control sets:              53
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             235 out of  54,576    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                       584 out of     218  267% (OVERMAPPED)
